# Skem

Your blueprints manager.

## Purpose

Skem was built to leverage the boilerplate it takes to create projects, or create file structures that are always very
similar. It helps in:

- Holding a local record of blueprints you created or added to your library
- Installing those blueprints on demand



## Installation

As for now, Skem needs to be installed as follow :

- npm
```shell
npm install
npm build
npm link
```

- yarn
```shell
yarn install
yarn build
yarn link
```

## CLI usage

### Help

If you are looking for help on the commands, just run `skem`, `skem help` (or `skem h`) for the general help.
For help on the commands, run `skem <command> --help` or `skem <command> -h`

### Add

To add a blueprint to your library run `skem add` (or `skem a`).

#### Options

Use the `--path` (or `-p`) option to tell where to source the blueprint from. The default is `.`.

Use the `--name` (or `-n`) option to provide the name you want to give to your blueprint.
If none is provided, the CLI will prompt a message for you to provide the name.

Use the `--repo` (or `-r`) option to add all the sub folder of a folder as individual blueprints.

### Install

To install a blueprint, just run `skem install` (or `skem i`).

#### Options

Use the `--path` (or `-p`) option to tell where to install the blueprint from. The default is `.`.

Use the `--name` (or `-n`) option to provide the name of the blueprint you want to install.
If no name is provided, skem will list the available blueprints you can then select from.
If part of a name is provided, skem will filter the available blueprints that contain the value passed as parameter.

Use the `--variable` (or `-v`) option to give the value of a variable used in the blueprint.

The values have to be provided as follows : `--variable name=test` and `--variable text='Lorem ipsum...'`

You can use this option multiple time: `skem install --variable name=test --variable text='Lorem ipsum...'`

### Update

To update the blueprints from their source, just run `skem update` (or `skem u`).

This will go to the root of the blueprints, read the configuration and update the local library.

#### Options

Use the `--name` (or `-n`) option to provide the name of the blueprint you want to update.
Updates all if no value is provided.

### Remove

To remove one or all the blueprints from the local library, just run `skem remove` (or `skem rm`).

#### Options

Use the `--name` (or `-n`) option to provide the name of the blueprint you want to remove.
Clears the library if no value is provided.

### List

To list the blueprints available in the local library, just run `skem list` (or `skem ls`).

### Print

To print information about a blueprint in the local library, just run `skem print` (or `skem p`).

#### Options

Use the `--name` (or `-n`) option to provide the name of the blueprint you want to print.
If no name is provided, skem will list the available blueprints you can then select from.

## Variables

You can use variables in a blueprint file or blueprint path (folder and/or file names).
Just wrap your variable name with 3 underscores `___my-variable___` and skem will identify them, and propmt to ask for a
value on installation.

## Skem config file

### Purpose

To hold information about the blueprint or the repository of blueprints, you can use a file called `skem.comfig.json`.

### Options

- `name`: <string> Provides the name of the blueprint attached to this folder.
- `singleFile`: <string> Tells the blueprint is composed of a single file.
This value is to set to the file path relative to the config file.
This option is incompatible with `singleFiles`.
- `singleFiles`: {file: string, name?: string}[] Array containing a list of files and blueprint names attached to the files.
Use this option if your folder holds a collection of files to be used individually.

### Examples

You can check the [schematics](./schematics) folder for examples about how to use the config files.
